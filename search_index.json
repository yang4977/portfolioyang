I'm a 1.5 generation Hmong-American womxn, born and raised in Minnesota. As a Hmong-American womxn, I have been exposed to prejudices within America\u2019s healthcare systems. A lack of representation and cultural communication barriers has greatly influenced my passion for strengthening my voice in order to advocate for marginalized communities. In December 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in Technical Writing and Communications and a minor in Public Health from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I continue to serve as a passionate advocate for underrepresented communities on a variety of healthcare disparities. In the future, I would like to work with nonprofit organizations in providing medical aid and resources to communities within Minnesota and all around the world. I strive to build a bridge of understanding for my community as we work towards equitable and accessible health care through technical communications.

I remember feeling intimidated, as I had little to no knowledge of writing through digital applications. However, with that intimidation, I felt motivationally challenged to expand my digital literacy. I was expected to explore digital writing technologies within their rhetorical contexts. Throughout the course, I gained a better understanding of writing for digital settings; including texts, sounds, images, videos, and overall interactivity. I also learned important vocabulary, functionality, and organizing structures of Web 2.0 environments. Semester Takeaways As I continued with course projects, I had gained immense knowledge of digital writing contexts. I was able to provide critical analysis in drafting web content design for the MN Austin Healey Club. I also engaged in structured authoring and markup language. Through trial and error, I had produced various deliverables using HTML and CSS files. I created repositories and published my files onto a GitHub-hosted site as well. Overall, the course has allowed me to engage in digital technologies as I am much more confident in my ability to navigate the digital writing scene. More specifically, I am able to identify, define, and solve digital writing issues; as well as understand diverse philosophies and cultures through a digital context.","title":"Coursereflection"},{"location":"coursereflection/#course-reflection-digital-literacy-narrative","text":"","title":"Course Reflection: Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"coursereflection/#course-development","text":"At the beginning of my Fall 2020 semester, I had enrolled in WRIT 4662W: Writing with Digital Technologies .

I have chosen to showcase these specific artifacts as I emphasize my experience in structured authoring with DITA and accessibility reflection with Markdown. Please also read my course reflection , as I reflect on my learning journey and expand my digital literacy narrative! DSLR Basic Photography Guide This guide was created as a structured authoring concept with DITA applications. I was able to manage DITA features in producing a manual for basic photography settings. You may find instructions on how to manage manual mode settings; including basic exposure settings and adjustment of the camera lens. I would like to emphasize my competencies in DITA application and structured authoring. LavaCon Presentation This reflection piece is representative of a virtual presentation from LavaCon 2020. With themes of usability writing, accessibility, and content strategy; I had chosen to reflect upon key takeaways from Mike Walkusky\u2019s UX Writing and Hip Hop: A Love Story. Lightweight documentation was generated through Markdown and published with GitHub. I would like to emphasize my competencies in Markdown language and GitHub repositories.","title":"Portfolio"},{"location":"portfolio/#portfolio","text":"This portfolio showcases specific artifacts created within WRIT 4662W: Writing with Digital Technologies.
